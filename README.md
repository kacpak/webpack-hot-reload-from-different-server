1. `yarn`
2. `yarn start`

This will open a static webserver on port 5000 serving content from "dist" directory.  
Additionally a webpack middleware server will start on port 3000, rebuilding application and saving changes to "dist" directory. 
Webpack is configured for hot-reloading and built packages connect to this server for updates.
